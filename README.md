# RK-Vin-Base
Total remake of the mod vin_Base from the game LifePlay<br>
<br>
Mod in Work In Progress (WIP)<br>
<br>
At the moment, to try the modifications, you need to delete or move the folder "stats" from C:\Games\LifePlay_4_0_Stable_64bit\LifePlay\Content\Modules\vin_Base\.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
Just delete or move the "Stats" folder to an another places in your pc for backup.<br>
C:\Games\LifePlay_4_0_Stable_64bit\LifePlay\Content\Modules\vin_Base\Stats<br>
<br>
After, enable the mod.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>What else does this mod bring more?</strong><br>
In my eyes, 80% of the scenes were created on the corner of a table ... I made the decision to create a mod better suited to my mods and everyday life in the LifePlay world, containing more complete scenes, more texts, more actions and possible consequences ...<br>

<h1>rk_vin_Base a remake of vin_Base mod</h1>
<p>Total remake of the mod vin_Base from the game LifePlay</p>
<p>https://github.com/vinfamy/LifePlay</p>
<br>
<h3>rk_vin_Base :</h3>
<p>Version: 0.0.1</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Mod in Work In Progress (WIP)</strong></p>
<br>
<p>At the moment, to try the modifications, you need to delete or move the folder "stats" from C:\Games\LifePlay_4_0_Stable_64bit\LifePlay\Content\Modules\vin_Base\.</p>
<br>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Just delete or move the "Stats" folder to an another places in your pc for backup.</p>
<p>C:\Games\LifePlay_4_0_Stable_64bit\LifePlay\Content\Modules\vin_Base\Stats</p>
<br>
<p>After, enable the mod.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>What else does this mod bring more?</strong></p>
<p>In my eyes, 80% of the scenes were created on the corner of a table ... I made the decision to create a mod better suited to my mods and everyday life in the LifePlay world, containing more complete/fixed scenes, more texts, more fun to play, more actions and possible consequences ...</p>
<br>
<p>I will also include all remaked scenes already made, who fit with rk_vin_Base, from other modders who are in/will join this project.</p>
<br>
<p>The goals with modders, example:</p>
<p>We have a file called sceneA.lpscene done by Vin</p>
<p>If the scene "sceneA" has been remade by Joe, we create a new version mixed with the version of Joe and that of Vin.</p>
<p>But Sophie, also has a version for the "sceneA" scene which can be included with the existing version in rk_vin_Base, made by Joe last time. So we mixed it to this story!</p>
<br>
<p>Other example:</p>
<p>Joe add this line to sceneA.lpscene</p>
<p>MainActor(Serene)::"That very really cool to you. I really need to improve my technical skills!"</p>
<br>
<p>But Alice, want to add a line to it, to make it less redundant.</p>
<p>So it became:</p>
<p>Random</p>
<p>    MainActor(Serene)::"That very really cool to you. I really need to improve my technical skills!" // Original Joe addition</p>
<p>   MainActor(Serene)::"Cool, I love participating in a training. Thank you for inviting me!" // Alice addition</p>
<p>EndRandom</p>

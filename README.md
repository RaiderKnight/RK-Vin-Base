<p>https://github.com/vinfamy/LifePlay</p>
<br>
<h3>rk_vin_Base :</h3>
<p>Version: 0.0.1</p>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Mod in Work In Progress (WIP)</strong><br>
<br>
At the moment, to try the modifications, you need to delete or move the folder "stats" from C:\Games\LifePlay_4_0_Stable_64bit\LifePlay\Content\Modules\vin_Base\.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
Just delete or move the "Stats" folder to an another places in your pc for backup.<br>
C:\Games\LifePlay_4_0_Stable_64bit\LifePlay\Content\Modules\vin_Base\Stats<br>
<br>
After, enable the mod.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>What else does this mod bring more?</strong><br>
In my eyes, 80% of the scenes were created on the corner of a table ... I made the decision to create a mod better suited to my mods and everyday life in the LifePlay world, containing more complete scenes, more texts, more actions and possible consequences ...<br>
<br>
I also want to include all remaked scenes, that I liked, already made from other modders.

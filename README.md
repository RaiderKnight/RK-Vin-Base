<p>Total remake of the game LifePlay</p>
<p>https://github.com/vinfamy/LifePlay</p>
<br>
<h3>rk_vin_Base :</h3>
<p>Version: 2.0.6</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>What else does this project bring more?</strong></p>
<br>
<p>- Almost all files inside vin_ folders have been edited.</p>
<p>- Menu better organized.</p>
<p>- Contain 75% more content and 40% more items.</p>
<p>- Universities have a purpose.</p>
<p>- More items to buy/eat/sale or trade.</p>
<p>- Most items you bought have a purpose.</p>
<p>- New stats (hunger, urge to pee, Christianity,...).</p>
<p>- More actions, choices, consequence and possibilities</p>
<p>- More online activities.</p>
<p>- You can buy an alarm system and/or train your dog to protect you.</p>
<p>- And a lot more...</p>
<p>- Updated almost every week.</p>
<br>
<p>In my eyes, 75% of the scenes are not complete enough or lack choice of actions or consequences ...</p>
<br>
<p>I made the decision to create a project better suited to my mods and to expand the LifePlay world, containing more completed/fixed scenes, more texts, more possible actions and consequences, less popup scenes, menu user with fewer elements (group actions / scenes into a single element), ...</p>
<br>
<p><strong>The goal is to:</strong></p>
<p>- Keep the original story</p>
<p>- Add more texts</p>
<p>- Add more choices</p>
<p>- Add more possibilities</p>
<p>- Add missing stats on certain scenes (mood, fitness, arousal, ...)</p>
<p>- Correct spelling mistakes</p>
<p>- Correct coding errors</p>
<p>- Reduce number of popup scenes</p>
<p>- Create scenes for "lpaction" files which do not have an assigned scene.</p>
<p>- Improve navigation in the user menu (menu on the left inside the game)</p>
<p>- Basically, completely improve this mod</p>
<p>- Add more texts and choices, to the files already edited ;)</p>
<br>
<p>I will also include all redone scenes, who fit with rk_vin_Base, from other modders or contributors who join this project.</p>

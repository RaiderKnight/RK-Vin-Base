    // Every NPCs that have already got the 'Cuck' tag (which could happen in almost all Netori scenes) will now occasionally invite you over to bang their SO when they watch. Their SO will gradually gain attraction to you and lose attraction to them. Eventually you can ask the SO to simply dump the cuck. Even after the cuck has been dumped, they will eventually start dating someone new and will again ask you to come over again to 'sample the new goods' and repeat the cycle.

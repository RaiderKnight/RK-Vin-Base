    // After you've done it with the boss's spouse or adult child once via the office errand scene, they may want more and call you to come over when your boss is out periodically. Threesome is possible for you've banged both. Eventually, they can become enamoured and want to be your bf / gf. With dating your boss's child, depending on the boss's existing rapport with you, they may threaten to fire you unless you leave their child alone, or actually be cool and give you a promotion for being their future son/daughter-in-law. With stealing your boss's spouse, you can either take the high road and accept getting sacked for it or plot with the spouse to get your boss fired due to false allegation of domestic violence and get a nice promotion to boot. You can also ask for a share of the divorce money.

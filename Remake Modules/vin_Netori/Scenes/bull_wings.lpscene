OTHER:

    // When hanging out with a friend at a nightclub or bar, your companion starts eyeing up someone who's already there with their SO. You can simply dissuade your friend or offer to be the wing(wo)man to distract the target's SO while your friend has a go. Your friend may suceed depending on their attractiveness and the target's perversion. If they fail on their own, there's the chance depending on the SO's submissiveness that the SO admits they have some cuckold fantasy and is looking for a bull. You can stick to the original wingman arrangement and offer your friend ... or offer yourself as the bull to essentially cuck both.

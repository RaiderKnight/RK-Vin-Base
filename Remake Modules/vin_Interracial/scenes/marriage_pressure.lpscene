    // If you're dating someone of Arab or South Asian descent (possible also if Latin or East Asian, but much lower chance) and have slept with them (chances double if you were their first), there's a chance their parents will eventually give them an ultimatum to either get you to marry them now, or break up with you and marry a 'nice traditional' boy/ girl from a family they know all the way back in their home country. You can give in and get married, or convince your bf/ gf to become estranged from their parents (success depends on their attraction to you) or just let them leave you to please their parents.

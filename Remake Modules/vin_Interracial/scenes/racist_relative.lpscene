    // When you're hanging out with a single friend of a different race at home, they may catch a glimpse of a relative living with you and ask you to hook them up. You can either simply say the relative isn't available, or explain that the relative has said some pretty racist stuffs about your friend's race in the past so it wouldn't work. If the latter, the friend will suggest a blind date and promise to change your relative's racist attitude for good after one night of passion. If you say yes, the blind date's success depends on how racist your relative is and your friend's attractiveness and interpersonal stats.

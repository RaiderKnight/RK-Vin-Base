    // You come across an 18-year-old elf/ orc virgin who runs away from their tribe after finding out they are the next annual tribute to a corrupt local official in exchange for letting their tribe live in peace. You can simply hand them over to their tribe for a small reward, offer to pay a big bribe to the official instead or threaten to expose the official using your law knowledge and connections (interpersonal + intelligence > 170). If you save the virgin, they'll feel oblidged to offer you their virginity instead. You can refuse for a huge karma boost.

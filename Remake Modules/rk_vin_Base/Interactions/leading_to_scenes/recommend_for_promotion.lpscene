    // If your jobexperience is at least 30 higher than a colleague, you're considered their superior and you can recommend them for a promotion in exchange for either some 'fun' (with them or their SO, the latter being generated when you ask for it according to your orientation if they don't currently have one) or for a big rapport and/or attraction boost. You can only recommend one subordinate for promotion every 2 weeks and obviously you can't abuse the interaction forever since eventually, they're promoted high enough to no longer be your subordinate

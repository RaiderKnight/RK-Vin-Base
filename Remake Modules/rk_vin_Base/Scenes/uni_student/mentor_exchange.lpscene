    // New action to "Mentor a foreign exchange student" (you can pick where they come from, but whether they have the stereotypes i.e. BBC, big Latina ass, etc depends on what you set if you have the Interracial module enabled). This person will stay in your city for one in-game month. If you don't participate in Greek life and live at home, the university may ask you to provide 'homestay' accommodation for this student as well (where they'll meet your relatives). Aside from the usual random / companion events, there are some specific events that can trigger featuring this exchange student when you take the mentor action, where you can simply gain some karma and interpersonal or end up hooking up with them but can also end up asking them to transfer permanently to your university (depends on their rapport with you, always succeeds if you've managed to turn them into your BF / GF already).

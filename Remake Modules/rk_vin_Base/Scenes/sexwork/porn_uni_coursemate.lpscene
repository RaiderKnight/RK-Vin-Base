    // If you're a unversity student who's also a por nstar, you're working on an assignment in a pair with another coursemate, who admits they've watched your videos. Depending on their interpersonal and perversion, they may be direct about having some fun as a break or be shy about it and wait for you to offer. When done once, they'll try to work in pairs with you again in the future.
    
    // On the other hand, if they're the same gender as you, this coursemate working in pairs with you may express their admiration for the skill you've shown in your por n performances instead. They ask you to teach them to improve their ability to satisfy a partner. This lesson could be done with their current partner, or you could suggest another practice target (who could become their partner afterwards unless already yours). After this first lesson, from time to time, they may continue to ask you to have fun with them and their partner, up to you whether you want to demand money for such service.

    // While looking for Johns, you may receive a high-paying offer to be the gift in a secretive birthday party, either alone or with other workers as well. It turns out the birthday boy/girl is an A-list celebrity (using one of the real face imports I did last year). There's a chance that the celeb is so satisfied with this 'gift' that they become one of your regular Johns from then on, which in time could end up as a sugar arrangement or an actual relationship.

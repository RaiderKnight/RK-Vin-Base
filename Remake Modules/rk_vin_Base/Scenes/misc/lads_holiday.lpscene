    // At home or travel agencies, you can now "Organize a group holiday abroad" to a party destination. You choose which country and choose three more friends with the same gender as you to bring along. Once there, your group ends up inviting a group of four locals back to your AirBnb to hang out and you get to pick your main target to flirt with. Depending on your and the others's willingness and skill in seduction (for example, if you invite along three guys with low interpersonal and attractiveness, or with low perversion and already in a relationship, you may end up with all the girls for yourself), the night may end up with all sorts of matchups. A lot of group fun may be involved, but if you instead remain committed to only one local girl/ guy for the night, you can ask them to become your gf/ bf and move back to your country with you. Your mates might also do the same if they have low perversion.

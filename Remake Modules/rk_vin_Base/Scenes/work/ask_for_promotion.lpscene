    // The jobexperience stat now translates roughly to your and your  colleagues' positions  within the company. You can increase this stat slowly via working or get a 20 point jump (along with a salary raise) with the new 'Ask for promotion' action available at work (which has a 2-week timeout if failed and 2-month timeout if succeeded, and success depends on your jobperformance + rapport with boss, which can be substituted for se x if perverted boss).

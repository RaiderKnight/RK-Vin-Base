    // If your SO or a past lover has very high submissiveness (which of course can be built up gradually by putting BDSM pieces on them during adult scenes) or attraction to you, you can click on them and become their master, which makes them wear a collar permanently and gives you the right to bang them or make them bang anyone anytime with no timeout. You can also tie them up and leave them in a dodgy part of town and let strangers have their ways with them.

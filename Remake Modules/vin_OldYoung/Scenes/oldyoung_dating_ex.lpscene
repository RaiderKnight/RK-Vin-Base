    // If the Netorare module is enabled and you're already in an age-gap relationship, you may find yourself feeling insecure that you don't quite have the vigor (if you're older) or the experience (if you're younger) to fully satisfy your SO. You can then offer to let them have some fun with someone their age while you watch (and maybe join for a threesome). You can pick from your contacts or let them call an ex.

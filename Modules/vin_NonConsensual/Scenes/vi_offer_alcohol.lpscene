OTHER: Random(0, 100) < attractiveness && !Player.isAsexual()

    // Frequently triggered scene (more frequent the higher your attractiveness) at nightclubs or bars where a stranger offers to buy you drink. Most of them are simply nice and don't have any bad intention except asking for your number, but that doesn't mean that you won't get increasingly drunk whenever you accept a drink, which leaves you vulnerable to other not-so-nice opportunists. The original stranger may then either save you or join in.

    // NPC X asks the player for dating advice and/or if they know someone whos available that might be interested. The player could then select NPC Y from their contacts, we can then see NPC X and Y talk, if X succeeds Y will agree to go out with them, to which the player could choose to follow them, theres a mention of a date, the player ends up following them back to a sex scene.  Afterwords the two NPCs would then be dating.
    // Thats pretty much it, I had an idea for a second but ended up merging them together. Ideally, there'd be an NTR version of the aforementioned as well, maybe the player's SO and NPC X would be flagged as dating without opening the relationship? I don't know if thats even supported. If anything I suggested isn't viable, or is simply too much for a scene commission I apologize.

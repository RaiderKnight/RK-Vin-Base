    // While walking your dog (you do this in the Contacts menu), your dog smells something and asks you to follow them to a pack of stray dogs who seem a bit restless. You could choose to help relieve them all, and if you walk away and the unofficial NC module is enabed, they'll turn aggressive and attack you instead. There's a chance a police gender same gender as you come across this attack and tries to help you, possibly only to get themselves the same fate.

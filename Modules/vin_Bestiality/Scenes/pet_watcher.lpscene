    // If you own a pet and are working in an office, sometimes you have to go on a business trip out of town for a few days. You'll be prompted to ask someone to watch your pet for you. Your business trip ends up being shorter than expected and you arrive home. Either nothing happens or because of either the pet's previous experience with you or your friend's high perversion, you catch them in the act. You can then get angry or join them.

    // Bestiality mod scene for porn worker: with low porn fame, a scene that triggers when looking for a shoot where the director offers an animal sex scene at low pay because of the low fame score, saying that the player has to show a willingness to do anything to make it in the industry.  But after accepting the job, there is then a strong chance that you will be black-listed from all modeling photo shoots and non-animal porn shoots. If player perversion stat is below 60, it reduces the mood stat to 0 (and if possible, nerfs the recovery rate of mood for 3 days)

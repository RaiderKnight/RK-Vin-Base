The Family's strict rules were read out before my finger was pricked with a needle by the Bos. A few drops of my blood were spilled on a card bearing the Family's patron saint, which was then set on fire. The burning card is passed rapidly from hand to hand, while I took the oath of loyalty to the Family."
